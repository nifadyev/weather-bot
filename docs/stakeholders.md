## Disclaimer

Currently (January 2024) I'm the only developer, user and interested person on this project.
So technically there is no need in dealing with one and only stakeholder. But for the sake of trying new System Analysis knowledge I've decided to make generic stakeholder groups and write their concerns. And build the project plan based on concerns' priority and stakeholder's group importance.

## List of stakeholders

- Management - The ones who make business decisions. Includes business, project/product managers and other types of managers
- Developers - The ones who implement the system. Includes DevOps, security. Aliases: maintainers, contributors
- Users - The ones who use the system. For now this group is not "honest" because developer of it's own product cannot act as typical user but this group is crucial and mandatory
- OpenWeatherMap API - External system. Mostly necessary for external limitations
