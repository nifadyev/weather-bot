# ADR-001: Continue development by making project's second version from scratch

## Context and Problem Statement

The project was aimed to be a sandbox for trying and making use of various best practices and tools.
It happened to go wrong from the beginning. Current state is partly working but the aim is not achieved.

## Considered Options

* Implement second version of project from scratch
* Implement second version of project based on current version
* Leave the project as it is, only support it and fix bugs
* Abandon project

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Implement second version of project from scratch", because it allows me to adopt chosen practices, improve developer experience and practice close-to-real development process after a long career break. Moreover, recently I finished [System Analysis course](https://tough-dev.school/system-analysis) and I've got a lot to test. The main drawback is amount of time required to make the project look it was thought to be. But in my opinion it is worth the effort.

Pros of option 2 are only applied to option 1 that's why option 1 is chosen. Option 3 and 4 have more cons than pros.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Implement second version of project from scratch

* Good, because it is possible to try long awaiting practices and tools
* Good, because I will be able to use fresh knowledge from *System Analysis Course*
* Good, because it will help me to remember development process after career break
* Good, because there is no need to shut down current version
* Bad, because it will require a lot of time and effort

### Implement second version of project based on current version

* Good, because the project will be revived and bugs will be fixed
* Good, because it will help me to remember development process after career break
* Good, because there is no need to shut down current version
* Neutral, because it will take acceptable amount of time
* Bad, because new features will be implemented on top of not optimal project architecture

### Leave the project as it is, only support it and fix bugs

* Good, because it will take least amount of time
* Bad, because project development will be stopped and the aim will be failed

### Abandon project

* Good, because it will take no time and I will be able to move to new project
* Bad, because it could become a habit not to finish any project
* Bad, because it will not help me to return after career break
